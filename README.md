Portfolio Project Codes Challenges Repository

Description:
This repository is to keep track of my Project & Portfolio coding assignments, and my class progress.


Coding Assignments:

I start creating the coding related to challenges in Notepad from my PC at work, and then I passed the codes to C Sharp, Visual Studio on my Mac. All this to work with my situation that interrupts my commitment to the class (time management). 
The first step consists of copy all the codes related to Menu, Swap Name and Backwards to the Main (inside Program.cs). After finishing coping all the codes, I make sure that there are no syntax errors and verify the execution of each program.

With the codes already working, I created the classes for each program, and I copied the codes: (Menu.cs, SwapName.cs and Backwards.cs). With the classes and codes ready, I created the function to call the methods from the Menu according to the user's selection. 
Note: Menu is calling from Program.cs

I need to validate the entries for SwapName and Backwards. Also, I need to pass the codes of the remaining programs: (Age Convert, Temp Convert, and Big Blue Fish). Finally, validate the executions.

I finish my draft in Notepad and I passed the rest of the codes to Visual Studio (Age Convert, Temp Covert and Big Blue Fish). I completed the validation and verification for all codes. Now, all programs are running and showing the results.

I upload the rest of the codes to my repository and completed comments in my previous codes.
